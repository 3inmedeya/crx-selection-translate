But don't worry, there is a solution to this problem. In this article, we will explain what causes the rld.dll error, how to fix it, and how to prevent it from happening again. Follow these simple steps and you will be able to play Lego The Lord of the Rings without any issues.
  
## What is Rld.dll and Why Does It Cause an Error?
 
Rld.dll is a dynamic link library file that is part of the SecuROM copy protection software. SecuROM is a program that prevents unauthorized copying and distribution of video games. Lego The Lord of the Rings uses SecuROM to verify that you have a legitimate copy of the game before allowing you to play it.
 
However, sometimes SecuROM can malfunction and cause the rld.dll error. This can happen for various reasons, such as:
 
- Your antivirus or firewall software is blocking or deleting rld.dll as a potential threat.
- Your rld.dll file is corrupted or missing due to a faulty installation or uninstallation of the game or another program.
- Your Windows registry has invalid or outdated entries related to rld.dll.
- Your system has malware or viruses that have damaged or infected rld.dll.

Any of these factors can prevent SecuROM from loading rld.dll properly and cause the game to crash. To fix this error, you need to address the root cause and restore rld.dll to its normal functioning.
  
## How to Fix Rld.dll Error in Lego The Lord of the Rings?
 
Depending on what is causing the rld.dll error in your case, you can try one or more of the following solutions:
  
### Solution 1: Disable or Whitelist Rld.dll in Your Antivirus or Firewall Software
 
One of the most common causes of the rld.dll error is that your antivirus or firewall software is interfering with SecuROM and rld.dll. Some security programs may mistakenly identify rld.dll as a malicious file and block or delete it. This can prevent SecuROM from verifying your game and cause it to fail.
 
To fix this, you need to disable your antivirus or firewall software temporarily while playing Lego The Lord of the Rings. Alternatively, you can whitelist rld.dll in your security program's settings and allow it to run without any restrictions. This way, you can keep your system protected while enjoying your game.
  
### Solution 2: Reinstall Lego The Lord of the Rings
 
Another possible cause of the rld.dll error is that your rld.dll file is corrupted or missing due to a bad installation or uninstallation of Lego The Lord of the Rings or another program that uses SecuROM. This can result in SecuROM not being able to find or load rld.dll correctly and cause the game to crash.
 
To fix this, you need to reinstall Lego The Lord of the Rings and make sure that all its files are installed properly. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Uninstall Lego The Lord of the Rings from your PC using the Control Panel or a third-party uninstaller tool.
2. Delete any leftover files and folders related to Lego The Lord of the Rings from your system.
3. Restart your PC.
4. Reinstall Lego The Lord of the Rings from your original disc or digital download source.
5. Run the game as an administrator and check if the error is gone.

### Solution 3: Repair Your Windows Registry
 
A third possible cause of the rld.dll error is that your Windows registry has invalid or outdated entries related to rld.dll. The Windows registry is a database that stores information about your system's settings and programs. Sometimes, the registry can get corrupted or cluttered due to various reasons, such as
