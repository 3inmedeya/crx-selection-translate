## How to Use Sketchup Instant Road Pro Plugin
` `
To use the Sketchup Instant Road Pro plugin, you need to have a terrain model and a path or a centerline for your road. You can create these using Sketchup tools or import them from other sources. The plugin works best with smooth and continuous paths or centerlines.
` `
Once you have your terrain and path ready, you can follow these steps to create your road:
` `
`
`1. Select your path or centerline and click on the Instant Road Nui icon on the toolbar.
`
`2. A dialog box will appear with various options for your road. You can adjust the road width, profile, materials, curbs, sidewalks, drainage, and other settings. You can also preview your road before creating it.
`
`3. When you are satisfied with your settings, click on OK to generate your road. The plugin will automatically cut and drape your road on the terrain and apply the materials and components.
`
`4. You can edit your road later by selecting it and clicking on the Edit icon on the toolbar. You can also delete your road by clicking on the Delete icon.
`
`
` `
The Sketchup Instant Road Pro plugin is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for creating realistic roads in Sketchup. It can save you time and effort and enhance your models with realistic details. If you want to learn more about the plugin, you can watch some video tutorials[^2^] or read the user manual[^3^] on the Vali Architects website.
